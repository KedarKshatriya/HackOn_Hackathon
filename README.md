# HackOn_Hackathon
 This repository is for the application's created during HackOn Hackathon. It has all the different components of the project. You can see our contribution at: https://devfolio.co/submissions/covidcare.

Description: This app was developed while thinking for solutions like:

1.) This application will be able to track the quarantined as well as non-affected person's and their symptoms will be monitored through our application continuously. 
2.) We have provided machine learning ðŸ¤– models which will help doctors to further confirm if a patient has a possibility or not just by clicking a picture of the persons CT Scan or X-RAY. 
3.) There is also a system implemented which will let the authorities like police or doctors know about the location of infected person for tracking. 
4.) We have also devloped a system which will keep the location of affected person's location anonymous but all the other users will know about the area's affected through our IV Hotspot feature. 
5.) The affected person has option to share his location with his friends so they can be notified about his conditons through the continuous tracking of application.

Do try both the apps Web App and Android App both are fully functional ðŸ¤©.

Some Technical terms introduced:

-> Infection Variable (I.V): It is a custom developed algorithm which will decide if the person is in either of these three states:
Safe => Green Marker ðŸŸ¢. 
Suspicious => Yellow Marker ðŸŸ¡. 
Infected => Red Marker ðŸ”´. 
When a user opens the application for first time he has to fill in a form which will define his IV values and accordingly he will be alloted a state mentioned above.

-> Anonymous Red Zones: These are the spots that are generated on our map when a person is detected as infectious. These spots are created on map to warn all the users about highly infectious areas.

-> Neighbourhood : This is a map which shows all of the friends location also their distance from the user and the state(IV) of the friends. All the users are shown in various colour markers according to their repective infection variables. This map also shows in realtime users location and all the red zones.
